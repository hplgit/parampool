__Summary.__ Parampool is a Python package for handling a potentially
large pool of input parameters in scientific applications. The
simplest use is to pass a Python function to Parampool and get back a
web interface for setting the arguments to the function. More powerful
use consists in defining a *pool* of input parameters, which is a tree
structure of input data, where data items (parameters) are organized
hierarchically in subpools. Each data item is associated with a name,
default value, unit, help text, widget type, validation information,
etc. Different types of sophisticated user interfaces can then be
automatically generated: a graphical web interface (via Flask or
Django), a command-line interface, and a file-based interface.  The
tutorial describes specific examples on how to to program Parampool to
generate user interfaces and how to operate them. With very little
efforts, you can take a scientific application and equip it with a
fancy GUI.

======= Simulation program used as sample app =======

We shall work with a sample application that takes a few variables as
input and produces numbers and/or graphs as result.  Specifically, our
application, later referred to as a *simulation program* or simply a
*simulator*, concerns the simulation of a ball thrown through air.
Given the initial velocity of the ball, and some other data like mass
and radius, we can compute the trajectory of the ball until it hits
the ground. The details of the calculations are not of interest here
as our focus is on software for assigning input data and for
displaying the results. However, the interested reader can consult the
box below for the inner workings of the simulation program.

#The various features of Parampool will be introduced in a series
#of examples where the complexity of input and the results ranges
#from very simple to quite advanced.

!bnotice Mathematical model
The motion of the mass center $\bm{r}$ of a body through a fluid is
given by
!bt
\begin{equation}
m\frac{d^2\bm{r}}{dt^2} = -m\bm{g} - \frac{1}{2}C_D\varrho A v^2\bm{i}_t
+ \frac{1}{2}C_L\varrho A v^2\bm{i}_n + \frac{1}{2}C_S\varrho A v^2(\bm{i}_t
\times \bm{i}_n),
label{pp:ballistic:eq1}
\end{equation}
!et
where

 * $m$ is the mass of the body,
 * $\bm{g}$ is the acceleration of
   gravity vector,
 * $C_D$ is a drag coefficient,
 * $\varrho$ is the density of air,
 * $A$ is the cross-section area of the body perpendicular to the
   motion,
 * $\bm{v}=d\bm{r}/dt$ is the velocity of the body,
 * $\bm{w}$ is a given wind velocity,
 * $v = |\bm{v}-\bm{w}|$ is the relative velocity between the
   body and the wind,
 * $C_L$ is a lift coefficient,
 * $C_S$ is a coefficient for the sidewind or lateral aerodynamic force,
 * $\bm{i}_t$ is a unit tangent vector of the body's path, while
 * $\bm{i}_n$ is a unit vector normal to the path tilting upwards.

The drag $C_D$ coefficient for a sphere is taken as 0.45. The lift
coefficient $C_L$ depends on the spinrate $\omega$ (rad
$\hbox{s}^{-1}$) of the body, and a simple linear relation often
suffices: $C_L = 0.2\omega/500$. A negative $\omega$ gives a negative
lift.

We can simplify the model for a two-dimensional motion in an $xy$
plane with unit vectors $\bm{i}$ and $\bm{j}$ in the $x$ and $y$
directions, respectively.  Then we skip the sidewind force
($C_S=0$). We also let gravity point downwards, $\bm{g}=-g\bm{j}$, and
let the wind velocity be horizontal: $\bm{w}=-w\bm{i}$. Furthermore,
we have that

!bt
\begin{align}
\bm{i}_t &= \frac{\bm{v}}{\left|\bm{v}\right|} \equiv a\bm{i} + b\bm{j},
\quad \bm{v} = \frac{d\bm{r}}{dt},\\
\bm{i}_n &= -b\bm{i} + a\bm{j}\hbox{ if }a>0\hbox{ else }b\bm{i}-a\bm{j}
\end{align}
!et
The initial conditions associated with (ref{pp:ballistic:eq1}) express
that the body starts at the origin with an initial velocity $v_0$
making an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal. In the two-dimensional
case the conditions become

!bt
\[ \bm{r}(0) = 0\bm{i} + 0\bm{j},\quad \frac{d\bm{r}}{dt}(0)=\bm{v}(0)=
v_0\cos\theta\bm{i} + v_0\sin\theta\bm{j}.\]
!et

======= User interfaces for Python functions =======
label{pp:GUI4functions}

Parampool can automatically generate user interfaces for communicating
with a given function.
The usage of this functionality will be explained in problems
of increasing complexity, using the trajectory of a ball as described
above as application.

===== Real numbers as input and output =====
label{pp:real:inout}

Suppose you have some function

!bc pycod
def compute_drag_free_landing(initial_velocity, initial_angle):
    ...
    return landing_point
!ec
This function returns the landing point on
the ground (`landing_point`) of a ball that is initially thrown with a
given velocity in magnitude (`initial_velocity`), making
an angle (`initial_angle`) with the ground. There are two real input
variables and one real output variable. The function must be available
in some module, here the module is simply called "`compute.py`":
"${src_path}/compute.py" (and
it also contains a lot of other functions for other examples).

In the following we shall refer to functions like `compute_drag_free_landing`,
for which we want to generate a web interface, as a *compute function*.

=== Flask interface ===

"Flask": "http://flask.pocoo.org/" is a tool that can be used to write
a graphical user interface (GUI) to be operated in a web browser. Here
we shall use Flask to create a GUI for our compute function, as
displayed in Figure ref{pp:flask1:fig1}. To this end, simply create a
Python file "`generate.py`": "https://github.com/hplgit/parampool/tree/master/doc/src/pp/src-pp/flask1" with the following lines:

@@@CODE src-pp/flask1/generate.py

The `generate` function grabs the arguments in our compute function and
creates the necessary Flask files.

FIGURE: [fig-pp/flask1.png, width=500 frac=0.6] A simple web interface. label{pp:flask1:fig1}


!bwarning Tip
We recommend to make a new directory for every web application.  Since
you need access to the `compute` module you must copy `compute.py` to
the directory or modify `PYTHONPATH` to contain the path to the
directory where `compute.py` resides.
!ewarning


Since the `generate` tool has no idea
about the type of variable of the two positional arguments in the
compute function, it has to assume some type. By default this will
be text, but we can change that behavior to be floats by the setting the
`default_field` argument to `FloatField`.
This means that the generated interface
will (only) accept float values for the input variables, which is
sufficient in our case.

A graphical Flask-based web interface is generated by running

!bc sys
Terminal> python generate.py
!ec

!bwarning
A message is written in the terminal window, saying that
with positional arguments in the compute function, one must normally
invoke the generated `controller.py` file and do some explicit
conversion of text read from the web interface to the actual variable
type accepted by the compute function.  This potential manual work can
be avoided by using keyword arguments only, so the generator
functionalty can see the variable type.
!ewarning

You can now view the generated web interface by running

!bc sys
Terminal> python controller.py
!ec
and open your web browser at the location
`http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Fill in values for the two input variables
and press *Compute*. The page in the Chrome browser will now look like Figure
ref{pp:flask1:fig1}. Other browsers (Firefox, for instance) may have a
slightly different design of the input fields. The figures in this tutorial
were made with the Chrome and Opera browsers.

!bnotice Generated files:
Readers with knowledge of Flask will notice
that some files with Flask code have been generated:

 * `model.py` with a definition of the forms in the web interface
 * `controller.py` which glues the interface with the compute function
 * `templates/view.html` which defines the design of the web interface

You are of course free to tailor these files to your needs if you know
about Flask programming. An introduction to Flask for scientific
applications is provided in cite{Langtangen:web4sciapps}.
A one-line Bash script, `clean.sh`, is also generated: it will remove
all files that were generated by running `generate.py`.
!enotice

=== Django interface ===

"Django": "https://www.djangoproject.com/" is a very widespread and popular
programming environment for creating web applications.
We can easily create our web application in Django too. Just replace `flask`
by `django` in "`generate.py`": "https://github.com/hplgit/parampool/tree/master/doc/src/pp/src-pp/django1":

@@@CODE src-pp/django1/generate.py

The Django files are now in the directory tree `drag_free_landing`
(same name as our compute function, except that any leading `compute_`
word is removed). Run the application by

!bc sys
Terminal> python drag_free_landing/manage.py runserver
!ec
and open your browser at the location `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
The interface looks the same and has the same behavior
as in the Flask example above.

!bnotice Generated files:
Quite some files are needed for a Django application. These are
found in the `drag_free_landing` directory tree. The most important
ones are

 * `models.py` with a definition of the forms in the web interface
 * `views.py` which glues the interface with the compute function
 * `templates/index.html` which defines the design of the web interface

With some knowledge of basic Django programming you can edit these
files to adjust the functionality.  Reference
cite{Langtangen:web4sciapps} provides a basic introduction to Django
for creating scientific applications.

===== A plot as output =====
label{pp:plot:output}

idx{Matplotlib plotting}

The result of the previous computation was just a number. Let us instead
make a plot of the trajectory of a ball without any air resistance.
The function

!bc pycod
def compute_drag_free_motion_plot(
    initial_velocity=5.0,
    initial_angle=45.0):
    ...
    return html_text
!ec
is now our compute function, in "`compute.py`":
"${src_path}/compute.py", which takes the same two
input arguments as before, but returns some HTML text that will display
a plot in the browser window. This HTML text is basically the inclusion
of the image file containing the plot,

!bc
<img src="X">
!ec
where `X` is the name of the file. However, if you do repeated
computations, the name of the image file must change for the browser to
update the plot. Inside the compute function we must therefore generate
a unique name of each image file. For this purpose, we can use the
number of seconds since the Epoch (January 1, 1970) as part of the filename,
obtained by calling `time.time()`. In addition, the image file must
reside in a subdirectory `static`. The appropriate code is displayed below.

!bc pycod
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
...
def compute_drag_free_motion_plot(
    initial_velocity=5.0,
    initial_angle=45.0):
    ...
    plt.plot(x, y)
    import time  # use time to make unique filenames
    filename = 'tmp_%s.png' % time.time()
    if not os.path.isdir('static'):
        os.mkdir('static')
    filename = os.path.join('static', filename)
    plt.savefig(filename)
    html_text = '<img src="%s" width="400">' % filename
    return html_text
!ec
The string version of the object returned from the compute function
is inserted as *Results* in the HTML file, to the right of the input.
By returning the appropriate HTML text the compute function
can tailor the result part of the page to our needs.

=== Flask application ===

The "`generate.py`": "https://github.com/hplgit/parampool/tree/master/doc/src/pp/src-pp/flask2" file for this example is similar to what is shown above.
Only the name of the compute function has changed:

@@@CODE src-pp/flask2/generate.py

!bnotice Tip
This time we do not need to specify `default_field` because we have
used keyword arguments with default values in the compute function.
The `generate` function can then from the default values see the
type of our arguments. Remember to use `float` default values
(like 5.0)
and not simply integers (like 5) if the variable is supposed to be a `float`.
!enotice

We run `python generator.py` to generate the Flask files and then
just writing `python controller.py` starts the web GUI. Now the default
values appear in the input fields. These can be altered, or you can
just click *Compute*. The computations result in a plot as
showed in Figure ref{pp:flask2:fig1}.

FIGURE: [fig-pp/flask2.png, width=800] A web interface with graphics. label{pp:flask2:fig1}

=== Django application ===

The corresponding Django application is generated by the same
"`generator.py`": "https://github.com/hplgit/parampool/tree/master/doc/src/pp/src-pp/django2" code as above, except that the word `flask` is replaced
by `django`. The Django files are
now placed in the `drag_free_motion_plot` subdirectory, and the web GUI
is started by running

!bc sys
Terminal> python drag_free_motion_plot/manage.py runserver
!ec
The functionality of the GUI is identical to that of the Flask
version.

=== Comparing graphs in the same plot ===

With a little trick we can compare several trajectories in the
same plot: inserting `plt.figure(X)` makes all `plt.plot` calls
draw curves in the same figure (with figure number `X`).
We introduce a boolean parameter
`new_plot` reflecting whether we want a new fresh plot or not,

!bc pycod
def compute_drag_free_motion_plot2(
    initial_velocity=5.0,
    initial_angle=45.0,
    new_plot=True):
!ec
and add the following code before the `plt.plot` call:

!bc pycod
global fig_no
if new_plot:
    fig_no = plt.figure().number
else:
    plt.figure(fig_no)
plt.plot(x, y, label=r'$v=%g,\ \theta=%g$' %
         (initial_velocity, initial_angle))
plt.legend()
!ec
The `new_plot` parameter will turn up as a
boolean variable in the web interface, and when checked, we create
a new figure. Otherwise, we draw curves in the existing figure number
`fig_no` which was initialized last time `new_plot` was true (with
a global variable we ensure that the value of `fig_no` survives between
the calls to the compute function).
Figure ref{pp:flask3:fig1} displays an attempt to not check `new_plot`
and compare the curves corresponding to three different parameters
(the files are in the "`flask3`": "https://github.com/hplgit/parampool/tree/master/doc/src/pp/src-pp/flask3" directory.

FIGURE: [fig-pp/flask3.png, width=800] Plot with multiple curves. label{pp:flask3:fig1}

!bwarning Caveat.
If `new_plot` is unchecked before the first computation is carried out,
`fig_no` is not defined when we do `plt.figure(fig_no)` and we get
a `NameError` exception. A fool-proof
solution is

!bc pycod
if new_plot:
    fig_no = plt.figure().number
else:
    try:
        plt.figure(fig_no)
    except NameError:
        fig_no = plt.figure().number
!ec
!ewarning

!bnotice Avoiding plot files
The compute function generates plot files with unique names, but we can
avoid making files at all and just insert the PNG code of the plot,
using base64 encoding,
as a long string directly in the HTML image tag. The statements
below sketches the idea:

!bc pycod
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# make plot
from StringIO import StringIO
figfile = StringIO()
plt.savefig(figfile, format='png')
figfile.seek(0)  # rewind to beginning of file
figdata_png = figfile.buf  # extract string
import base64
figdata_png = base64.b64encode(figdata_png)
html_text = '<img src="data:image/png;base64,%s" width="400">' % \
            figdata_png
!ec

There is a convenient function `parampool.utils.save_png_to_str`
performing the statements above and returning the `html_text`
string:

!bc pycod
from parampool.utils import save_png_to_str
# make plot in plt (matplotlib.pyplot) object
html_text = save_png_to_str(plt, plotwidth=400)
!ec
With this construction one can very easily avoid plot files and
embed the plot directly in the HTML code `html_text`:

!bc htmlcod
<img src="data:image/png;base64,..." width="...">
!ec
!enotice

!bnotice Matplotlib without X server
Matplotlib is by default configured to work with a graphical user interface
which may require an X11 connection. When running applications on a web
server there is a possibility that X11 is not enabled, and the user will get
an error message. Matplotlib thus needs to be configured for use in such
environments. The configuration depends on what kinds of images the user
wants to generate, but in most cases it is sufficient to use the `Agg` backend.
The `Agg` backend is created to make PNG files, but it also recognizes other
formats like PDF, PS, EPS and SVG. The backend needs to be set before importing
pyplot or pylab:

!bc pycod
import matplotlib as mpl
mpl.use('Agg')
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
!ec
!enotice

idx{Bokeh plotting}

=== Bokeh plotting ===

One can use the Bokeh library for plotting instead of Matplotlib,
see cite{Langtangen:web4sciapps} for an example. The major problem
is that Parampool generates the `view.html` file and the head and
body parts of the HTML file generated by Bokeh must be inserted in
the `view.html` file at the right places. This can be done
manually or by a suitable script.

idx{mpld3 plotting}

=== mpld3 plotting ===

The "mpld3": "http://mpld3.github.io" library can be used to convert
Matplotlib plots to a string containing all the HTML code
for the plot:

!bc pycod
# Plot array y vs x
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt, mpld3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x, y)
html_text = mpld3.fig_to_html(fig)
!ec
It is relatively easy to create interactive plots with mpld3.

idx{highcharts}
idx{`pandas_highcharts`}

=== Pandas highcharts plotting ===

The "pandas-highcharts": "https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandas-highcharts/"
package is another strong and popular alternative for interative
plotting in web pages.


===== More input parameters and results =====
label{pp:flask4}

It is time to address a more complicated application: we want
to compute the trajectory of a ball subject to air drag and lift
and compare that trajectory to the one where
drag and lift are omitted. We also want to visualize the
relative importance between the three forces: gravity, drag, and lift.
The lift is caused by spinning the ball.

The function that performs the computations has the following signature:

@@@CODE src-pp/compute.py fromto: def compute_motion_and_forces@"""
and returns a formatted string `html_text` with two plots organized
in an HTML table.

=== The returned HTML code ===

The technique described in the
*Avoiding plot files* box at the end of Section ref{pp:plot:output} is
implemented to embed PNG images directly in the HTML code.
Under the plots there is a table of input values and the landing point.
Curves can be accumulated in the plots (`new_plot=True`), with
the corresponding data added to the table.
A rough sketch of the HTML code returned from the compute
function goes as follows:

!bc htmlcod
<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAA..." width="400">
</td>
<td valign="top">

</tr>
</table>

<tr>
<td align="center"> \( v_0 \)  </td>
<td align="center"> \( \theta \) </td>
<td align="center"> \( \omega \) </td>

<tr><td align="right"> 5 </td><td align="right"> 45 </td> ...</tr>
<tr><td align="right"> 5 </td><td align="right"> 45 </td> ...</tr>
</table>
</center>
!ec
Note that we use MathJax syntax for having LaTeX mathematics
in the table heading.
All details about the computations and the construction
of the returned HTML string can be found in the "`compute.py`":
"${src_path}/compute.py" file.

FIGURE: [fig-pp/flask4.png, width=850] Web interface with two graphs. label{pp:flask4:fig1}

=== Documentation of the application ===

The Parampool `generate` function applies the convention that
any doc string of the compute function is copied and typeset verbatim
at the top of the web interface. However, if the text `# (DocOnce
format)` appears somewhere in the doc string, the text is taken as
"DocOnce": "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce" source code and
translated to HTML, which enables typesetting of LaTeX mathematics and
computer code snippets (with nice pygments formatting).

The documentation of the web interface can therefore be included as a
doc string in the compute function. Here is descriptive doc string
using DocOnce syntax for LaTeX mathematics (equations inside `!bt` and
`!et` commands)
and monospace font for Python variables (names in backticks). The
corresponding view in a browser is shown in Figure ref{pp:flask4:fig2}.

!bc
"""
This application computes the motion of a ball with radius $R$
and mass $m$ under the influence of gravity, air drag and lift
because of a given spinrate $\omega$. The motion starts with a
prescribed initial velocity $v_0$ making an angle initial_angle
$\theta$ with the ground. A wind velocity $w$, positive in
positive $x$ direction, can also be given.

The ordinary differential equation problem governing the
motion reads

|bt
\begin{align*}
m\frac{d^2\bm{r}}{dt^2} &= -mg\bm{j} -
\frac{1}{2}C_D\varrho A v^2\bm{i}_t +
\frac{1}{2}C_L\varrho A v^2\bm{i}_n\\
\bm{r}(0) &= 0\bm{i} + 0\bm{j}\\
\frac{d\bm{r}}{dt}(0) &= v_0\cos\theta\bm{i} + v_0\sin\theta\bm{j},
\end{align*}
|et
where $\bm{i}$ and $\bm{j}$ are unit vectors in the $x$ and $y$
directions, respectively, $g$ is the acceleration of gravity,
$A$ is the cross section area normal to the motion, $\bm{i}_t$
is a unit tangent vector to the trajectory, $\bm{i}_n$ is
a normal vector (pointing upwards) to the trajectory,
$C_D$ and $C_L$ are lift coefficients, and $\varrho$ is the
air density. For a ball, $C_D$ is taken as 0.45, while
$C_L$ depends on the spinrate through $C_L=0.2\omega/500$.

Many numerical methods can be used to solve the problem.
Some legal names are `ForwardEuler`, `RK2`, `RK4`,
and `Fehlberg` (adaptive Runge-Kutta 4/5 order).  If the
timestep `dt` is None, approximately 500 steps are used, but
`dt` can also be given a desired `float` value.

The boolean variable `plot_simplified_motion` adds the curve
of the motion without drag and lift (the standard parabolic
trajectory). This curve helps illustrate the effect of drag
and lift. When `new_plot` is `False` (unchecked), the new
computed curves are added to the previous ones since last
time `new_plot` was true.

The "`generate.py`": "https://github.com/hplgit/parampool/tree/master/doc/src/pp/src-pp/flask4" code for creating the web GUI goes as in the other examples,

@@@CODE src-pp/flask4/generate.py
and we start the application as usual by `python controller.py`.  The
resulting web interface appears in Figure ref{pp:flask4:fig1}.  The
table shows the sequence of data we have given; starting with the
default values, then turning off the `plot_simplified_motion` curve
and `new_plot`, then running two cases with different values for the
wind parameter `w`.  The plot clearly show the influence of drag and
wind against the motion.

!bwarning MathJax
The `compute_motion_and_forces` function returns mathematical symbols
in the heading line of the table with data.
MathJax must be enabled in the HTML code for these symbols to be
rendered correctly. This is specified by the `MathJax=True` argument
to `generate`. (However, in this particular example MathJax is
automatically turned on since we use DocOnce syntax and mathematics
in the doc string.)
!ewarning


=== Django interface ===

As before, the Django interface is generated by importing the function
`generate` from `parampool.generator.django`.
A subdirectory `motion_and_forces` contains the files, and the
Django application is started as shown in previous examples and has the same
functionality as the Flask application.


===== Other types of input data =====

The `generate` function will recognize the following different types
of keyword arguments in the compute function:
`float`, `int`, `bool`, `str`, `list`,
`tuple`, `numpy.ndarray`, name of a file, as well as user-defined class types
(a la `MyClass`).

=== Uploading a file ===

Here is a minimalistic example on computing the mean and standard
deviation of data either in an array or in a file (we use the
file if the operator of the web interface assigns a name
in the ``filename'' entry):

@@@CODE src-pp/compute.py fromto: def compute_average@if __name
The output is simple, basically two numbers in a table and an intro line.

We write a "`generate.py`": "https://github.com/hplgit/parampool/tree/master/doc/src/pp/src-pp/flask5" file as shown before, but with `compute_average`
as the name of the compute function. For any argument containing
the string `filename` it is assumed that the argument represents
the name of a file. The web interface will then feature a button
for uploading the file.

When the application runs, we have two data fields: one for setting an
array with list syntax and one for uploading a file. Clicking on the
latter and uploading a file `mydata.dat` containing just columns of
numbers, results in the web page displayed in Figure
ref{pp:flask5:fig1}. In this case, when a filename was assigned, we
use the data in the file.  Alternatively, we can instead fill in the
data array and click *Compute*, which then will compute the basic
statistics of the assigned data array.

FIGURE: [fig-pp/flask5.png, width=500] Web interface for uploading a file. label{pp:flask5:fig1}

======= Working with a pool of input parameters =======
label{pp:flask_pool1}

Parampool's main focus is on scientific applications with lots of
input data of different type, organized in a hierarchical tree fashion.
The various input parameters are defined in terms of a *pool*.
The pool can be defined as a nested list or through a function
application programming interface (known as an API, and here
consisting of calls functionality in the `parampool.pool` package).

To exemplify the use of pools, we apply the
`compute_motion_and_forces` function (from
Section ref{pp:flask4}):

@@@CODE src-pp/compute.py fromto: def compute_motion_and_forces@"""
Let us organize the 10 input parameters into four subpools. At the top
level we need a subpool, usually called "Main pool" or named after
the application. Each subpool
is here specified with a logical name of each parameter and the
corresponding variable name in the compute function:

 * Main pool
   * Initial motion data
     * Initial velocity: `initial_velocity`
     * Initial angle: `initial_angle`
     * Spinrate: `spinrate`
   * Body and environment data
     * Wind velocity: `w`
     * Mass: `m`
     * Radius: `R`
   * Numerical parameters
     * Method: `method`
     * Time step: `dt`
   * Plot parameters
     * Plot simplified motion: `plot_simplified_motion`
     * New plot: `new_plot`

With a pool we can give the parameters more readable logical names (not
restricted to a valid variable name in Python), but we can also
specify a lot other properties too, as will be explained.

!bwarning: Parameter names must be unique!
The generated Flask or Django code has a class (in `model.py` or
`models.py` for Flask and Django, respectively) where each parameter name
is transformed to a static class variable. Such code requires each
parameter to have a unique name. (Using variable names that merge the
parameter name with its subpool path would solve this problem.)

idx{subpool} idx{data item}

A pool is a hierarchical *tree structure* with *subpools* and
*data items*, where each data item describes an input parameter
in the problem. The task now is to make a Python specification of
the of subpools and data items in the pool tree.

===== Specifying a pool as a list =====
label{pp:flask_pool1:list}

The pool tree can be specified as a list of lists, strings, and dictionaries.
Each list represents a subpool, each string the name of the subpool,
and each dict is a data item. The pool must be return from some
function, hereafter called the *pool function*. In our case, the
pool function goes as follows:

@@@CODE src-pp/compute.py fromto: def pool_definition_list@def convert_time_step
Actually, the pool function must return a `parampool.pool.Pool` object,
so after the definition of the pool tree as a list we must make the
shown conversion from a list to a `Pool` object via the `listtree2Pool`
function.

===== Attributes in data items =====
label{pp:flask_pool1:dataitem}

Each data item has a name and preferably a default value, as in the
case of ``Initial velocity''. More attributes can be added:

 * `widget` specifies the type of widget used in a graphical
   user interface. Legal values are `integer`, `float`, `range`
   (requires the `minmax` attribute too), `integer_range` (requires
   the `minmax` attribute too), `textline`, `textarea` (for larger
   multi-line texts), `checkbox` (for boolen variables), `select`
   (list of options), `email`, `password`, `file` (for a filename
   of a file to be uploaded, `url`, `hidden` (for an invisible field),
   and `tel` (for a phone number). If not given, `widget` is based
   on the value of the `str2type` attribute or the type of the default value.
 * `minmax` is a 2-list or 2-tuple with lower and upper bound in
   the interval of legal values of a number.
 * The `range_steps` attribute, valid when `widget` is `range`,  specifies the
   steps in the slider used to select the number.
   In our example,
   we can select the ``Initial angle'' in unit steps between 0 and 90
   degrees.
 * `unit` specifies a unit, e.g., `1/s` or `kg/m**3`.
   If the input contains another unit, e.g., `4 1/h`, the value will
   be automatically converted to the registered unit ($4/3600$ 1/s
   if 1/s is the registered unit).
   (Parampool applies the the `PhysicalQuantity` object from the
   ScientificPython package to perform computations with units.
   A copy of this object is bundled with Parampool.)
 * `help` adds a help string to explain more about the parameter and
   how it can be set.
 * `number_step` specifies the precision of `float` or `integer`
   widgets if `minmax` is also specified (default 0.001), otherwise
   the precision is arbitrary.
 * `str2type` is a conversion function from a string (text given in
   a user interface) to the right type for the parameter. A value
   of `str2typ2` is automatically assigned if `widget` is given, otherwise
   Parampool applies the default value to find the right `str2type` function.
   This means that it is strictly not necessary to assign `str2type` for the
   ``Wind velocity'' data item since the default value `0.0` implies
   `str2type=float`. With more complicated objects one can
   assign a user-given conversion function to `str2type` (shown later).
 * `option` is a list of options for a `select` widget. The ``Method''
   data item (for the name of the numerical solution method)
   provides an example of this widget type.
 * `validate` holds a function that takes the value of the data item
   as argument and returns `True` or `False` depending on whether
   the value can be accepted or not.
 * `symbol` contains a mathematical LaTeX symbol that will be used
   in Flask or Django interfaces instead of the name of data item.
 * `widget_size` specifies the size (width) of fields in graphical
   user interfaces.
 * The `textline` widget must be used for default values that are `None`,
   because another value or the text `None` can be written in
   the field. In this case, `str2type` is automatically set to `eval`
   and any valid Python expression is then essentially allowable,
   but wrong object types may give errors in the compute function.

!bnotice Check that default values are real numbers
If a default value is set to `5`, Parampool will interpret this as an
integer and let `string2type` be `int` and force all input to be
converted to integers. Normally, you want input to be real, so check
that the default value is `5.0` unless the pool item is really meant to be
an integer.
!enotice

===== The compute function =====
label{pp:flask_pool1:compute}

When working with pools, the compute function is allowed to take *only
one argument* called `pool`. This object is used to extract
input data. Basically, the value of any data item `my parameter`
in the pool is extracted by

!bc pycod
variable = pool.get_value('my parameter')
!ec
In case multiple data items have the same name, a sufficient part
of the subpool path must be given, e.g.,

!bc pycod
variable = pool.get_value('My Subpool1/my parameter')
!ec
Our specific compute function is a wrapper for `compute_motion_and_forces`:

@@@CODE src-pp/compute.py fromto: compute_motion_and_forces_with_pool\(@def compute_motion_and_forces_with_pool_loop\(

The assumption is that the pool object provides enough input data for
the compute function. If this assumption does not hold and extra
information is needed, one can
simply make a class, store extra data as attributes in the class,
and let the compute function be a method in the class.

===== A command-line and file interface =====
label{pp:flask_pool1:cml_file}

Having defined a pool, it is trivial to get a command-line interface
in the application. Just write

!bc pycod
from parampool.pool.UI import set_values_from_command_line
pool = set_values_from_command_line(pool)
!ec
Now `pool` has values loaded from the command line. The name of
the command-line options follow the names in the pool, but with
underscore replacing whitespace: `--Initial_motion_data/Initial_angle`.
However, in this case just writing `--Initial_angle` also works since it is a
unique name in the pool tree, and then we do not need the complete
path with the subpool name.

One can also read data from a file with syntax

!bc dat
subpool Initial motion data
  Initial angle = 45.5        # small perturbation
  Spinrate = 20
end
subpool Body and environment data
  Wind velocity = -10  ! m/s  # units appear after ! (before #)
end
!ec
Data from the file is loaded into the pool by

!bc pycod
from parampool.pool.UI import set_defaults_from_file
pool = set_defaults_from_file(pool)
!ec
To activate reading from file `mydat.dat`, one must supply the
command-line arguments `--poolfile mydat.dat`.

!bnotice Tip: autogenerate the file with default data
The function `write_poolfile(pool)` in `parampool.pool.UI`
writes the current pool data to a file with the right syntax.
This is a simple way of getting the complete pool in the file.
!enotice

Often, an application will first load default values from file,
then from the command line, and finally launch the graphical web
interface for enabling interactive setting of values in the pool system.
Automatic generation of such interactive web interfaces constitutes
the next topic. The lines above for loading parameters from file
and command line are automatically generated when a web interface
is requested (see also comments in Section ref{pp:flask_pool1:GUI_cml_file}).


===== A web-based user interface =====
label{pp:flask_pool1:GUI}

With a pool function and a compute function at hand,
it remains to make a new directory, copy the module(s) containing
the pool function and compute function to this directory,
and write a "`generate.py`": "https://github.com/hplgit/parampool/tree/master/doc/src/pp/src-pp/flask_pool1" file with the content

@@@CODE src-pp/flask_pool1/generate.py

The `generate` function will now use the information in the pool
(and not the arguments in the compute function!) to generate
a flexible user interface. Note that an Internet connection
is required. After running

!bc sys
Terminal> python generate.py
!ec
several Flask files and directories are generated (`model.py`, `controller.py`,
`templates`, `static`, and a simple clean-up script `clean.sh`).
The user interface is started by

!bc sys
Terminal> python controller.py
!ec
Open the URL `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in a web broswer to see an interface
as the one in Figure ref{pp:flask_pool1:fig1}.

FIGURE: [fig-pp/flask_pool1_closed.png, width=800] Web interface in closed form. label{pp:flask_pool1:fig1}


===== Operating the graphical web interface =====
label{pp:flask_pool1:GUI_op}

The pool tree is mapped onto a visual structure often used for
directory trees. The look and feel resemble that of the Windows
Explorer application in the Windows operating system.

Clicking on *open all* at the top of the user interface
expands all subpools so that all parameters (data items) become visible.
Figure ref{pp:flask_pool1:fig2} displays the result in the Opera browser.
Note that in this type of user interface, the name of each data item
is automatically typeset in LaTeX and inserted as a picture (the
URL: "http://latex.codecogs.com" utility is used).

FIGURE: [fig-pp/flask_pool1_open.png, width=800] Web interface in fully expanded form. label{pp:flask_pool1:fig2}

The following technical points must be mentioned.

 o A plain float or integer value gives a `textline` widget,
   while if a `minmax`
   range is specified, a `float` or `integer` widget
   (so-called HTML5 number field) is chosen.
 o Data items whose widgets are specified as `float` or `integer`, or
   where this is implied because `str2type` is `float` or `int`, or
   the default value is a `float` or `int` *and* the `minmax` attribute
   is assign, are shown using the "HTML5 input field":
   "http://www.wufoo.com/html5/" called number.
   This is recogned by the small (and not so useful) arrows that can be
   used to adjust the number,
   but usually typing in the number manually is faster and more precise.
   An extra attribute, `number_step` controls the stepping when clicking
   on the arrows and also the allowed precision of a typed number
   (same as `number_step`, which by default is 0.001).
 o When the widget is `range`, an HTML5 range field is used, which is
   usually rendered as a slider in browsers. The slider gets by default
   100 steps (can be changed or specified individually for any data item).
 o With the `select` widget we get a pull-down menu with the different
   options.
 o Any data item whose default value is `True` or `False` maps directly to
   a checkbox for boolean parameters.
 o Any data item with `unit` specified maps to an ordinary text field,
   since input consists of a number with an optional text for the unit.
   That is, if we choose to set `unit='m/s'` for the ``Initial velocity''
   data item, the input field will not the an HTML5 number field, but
   a standard HTML text field.
 o The names of the data items are typeset in LaTeX and shown as
   PNG images. This means that data item names may contain
   mathematical expressions: `Spinrate $\omega$` for instance.

!bwarning
The HTML5 number field is rendered differently in different browsers.
This can lead to strange layout of the input fields. In such cases
it is recommended to avoid the HTML5 number field. This is easiest
accomplished by explicitly specifying `widget` to be `textline`.
This is also the default widget type if you equip the number
with a unit or do not specify any widget, just a float or integer
default value.
!ewarning

We can try out the interface:

 o Set ``Initial velocity'' to 8.
 o Move the slider for ``Initial angle'' to 55.
 o Add a positive ``Wind velocity'' of -3.
 o Specify ``Mass''as the text `0.1*1000 g` (i.e., we use g rather
   than the default kg as unit, but the value is still 0.1 kg).
 o Choose `RK2` for ``Method''.
 o Set ``Time step'' to 0.12.
 o Uncheck the ``Plot simplified motion'' boolean value.
 o Hold the mouse pointer over the
   ``Wind velocity'' field to see the help string. Then point the mouse
   to  ``Mass'' input field and the specified unit pops up.
   A combination of help
   and unit information is showed if both are given in the
   data item definition.

You should see something like Figure ref{pp:flask_pool1:fig3}.

FIGURE: [fig-pp/flask_pool1_filled.png, width=800] Web interface with input parameters filled out. label{pp:flask_pool1:fig3}

Now, press the *Compute* button. Figure ref{pp:flask_pool1:fig4} shows
the resulting response. You can now play around and click the checkbox
for *Plot simplified motion* and the recompute to see the effects
of wind against the motion, drag, and lift (which are substantial in
this example).

FIGURE: [fig-pp/flask_pool1_result.png, width=800] Web interface with input and results. label{pp:flask_pool1:fig4}

===== Detection of wrong input =====
label{pp:flask_pool1:GUI_error}

__Text in a number field.__
Write `abc` in the ``Initial velocity'' field and press the *Compute* button.
The error message ``Please enter a number'' pops up.

__Failure of user-provided validate function.__
Give a negative value for ``Mass''.
The ``Mass''data item has a validation function provided by us.
A `False` value returned from this function gives rise to a
`DataItemValueError` shown in the browser. It reads here

!bc
Mass = -0.1: validate function <lambda> claims invalid value.
!ec

__Failure of converting string to right type.__
Write `abc` for ``Radius''. This is a text field so any
text is in principle valid, but Parampool raises a `TypeError`
with the message

!bc
could not apply str2type=<type 'float'> to value abc <type 'str'>
!ec

__Failure in the compute function.__
Give a list `[0.1, 0.2]` for ``Time step''. Since the default is `None`,
which causes `str2type=eval`, any Python expression is accepted in
the interface, but the compute function used in our example
in this tutorial will raise a `TypeError`
because `float(dt)` fails when `dt` is a list. One could think
of providing a tailored `str2type` function in this case:

!bc pycod
def convert_time_step(value):
    # Value must be None or a float
    if value == 'None':
        return None
    else:
        try:
            return float(value)
        except TypeError:
            raise TypeError(
	    'Time step: could not convert "%s" to float, '
	    'must be None or float' % value)
!ec
Setting `str2type=convert_time_step` for the ``Time step'' data item
gives an informative error message if the answer is not as expected:
`None` or a floating-point number.

===== Loading parameters from file and the command line =====
label{pp:flask_pool1:GUI_cml_file}

Parameters can be assigned default values in a file and then other
values on the command line, see Section ref{pp:flask_pool1:cml_file},
before the web GUI is offered to the user. When autogenerating the web
interface, the magic lines from Section ref{pp:flask_pool1:cml_file}
are automatically inserted in the `controller.py` file (for Flask or
`views.py` for Django).  This means that when starting `python
controller.py` we may add `--poolfile name` and any set of
command-line options for setting individual parameters. This makes it
easy to control which default values that will appear in the web GUI.

===== Common trouble: ``Address already in use'' =====

Sometimes, after much trial and error with developing a graphical
user interface, one gets an error message that the IP address is
already in use.
To recover from this problem, run the `lsof` program to see which program
that applies the 5000 port (Flask runs its server on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`,
which means that it uses the 5000 port). Find the PID of the program
that occupies the port and force abortion of that program:

!bc sys
Terminal> lsof -i :5000
COMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE  DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
python  48824  hpl    3u  IPv4 1128848      0t0  TCP ...
Terminal> kill -9 48824
!ec
Now you can restart the application.

===== Specifying a pool using an API =====

Instead of listing all the entries in the pool tree as strings, lists,
and dicts in a nested data structure, you can use the
Application Programming Interface (API) of the `parampool.pool` package.
The pool defined above is alternatively programmed like this using
the API:

@@@CODE src-pp/compute.py fromto: def pool_definition_api@pool_definition_api_with_separate_subpools
The API is in many ways easier to use than the nested data structure
with lists, strings, and dicts. The API resembles moving around in
a file tree. The rules are simple:

 * `pool.subpool(path)` moves us to a subpool `path`, and creates
   it first if it does not exist. This is similar to `cd path`
   in a file tree, or `mkdir path; cd path`, if `path` does not
   exist.
 * The name of a subpool, `path`, follows the rule of file and
   directory names in a file tree: a slash is used as delimiter
   between subpools and data items. For example:

     * `/Main pool/Initial motion data/Initial velocity` is the
       full path to the ``Initial velocity'' data item.
     * Standing in the ``Initial motion data'' subpool,
       `..` is the parent subpool (``Main pool''), while
       `../Numerical parameters` is the correct path to the
       ``Numerical parameters'' subpool. That is, we can use
       relative and absolute paths as in a file tree.
 * A data item is appended to the current subpool by
   calling `pool.add_data_item`.

The look and functionality
of this GUI (found in the "`flask_pool2`": "https://github.com/hplgit/parampool/tree/master/doc/src/pp/src-pp/flask_pool2" directory) are
the same as in the previous one (found in the "`flask_pool1`": "https://github.com/hplgit/parampool/tree/master/doc/src/pp/src-pp/flask_pool1"
directory).

===== Specifying a pool using an alternative API =====

There is an another way of defining subpools as well: make a function
for defining each subpool.

@@@CODE src-pp/compute.py fromto: pool_definition_api_with_separate_subpools@def compute_motion_and_forces_with_pool

This application, found in the directory
"`flask_pool3`": "https://github.com/hplgit/parampool/tree/master/doc/src/pp/src-pp/flask_pool3" (with a corresponding "Django counterpart":
"https://github.com/hplgit/parampool/tree/master/doc/src/pp/src-pp/django_pool3"),
will now be used to illustrate three important additional features
of Parampool:

 o documentation of the application is in an external file `doc.html`
 o the name of a parameter can be a mathematical symbol
 o parameters can have multiple values for investigating many
   parameter sets at once

=== File with documentation of the application ===

We have in Section ref{pp:flask4} seen that the doc string of
the compute function may contain a mathematical description of
the problem with rich typesetting (using DocOnce syntax).
It is also possible to make such a description in a separate
file. Any HTML file will work, and the filename is specified by
the `doc` argument to `generate`.

=== LaTeX symbol as parameter name ===

One can add a mathematical
LaTeX symbol for the parameter names (the `symbol` keyword argument).
This symbol can either be displayed as the parameter's complete name,
or the symbol can be added to the standard name of the parameter.
The choice is set by the `latex_name` keyword argument in the
`generate` call in "`generate.py`": "https://github.com/hplgit/parampool/tree/master/doc/src/pp/src-pp/flask_pool3":

@@@CODE src-pp/flask_pool3/generate.py
The values of `latex_name` can be `'symbol'`, meaning symbol only, or
`'text, symbol'`, meaning that the ordinary name is
followed by a comma and the symbol.

=== Multiple input values for parameters ===

We can specify multiple values for parameters whose input fields are
pure text fields. For example, for the wind velocity ($w$) parameter
we can assign two values separated by the `&` character: `0 & -8`.
Calling `pool.get_values('Wind velocity')` will then return
a list `[0, -8]` rather than one number. We can hence easily
make a loop over the multiple values for each parameter where we
use pure text as input. Our compute function looks in this case
like this:

@@@CODE src-pp/compute.py fromto: def compute_motion_and_forces_with_pool_loop\(@def compute_motion_and_forces_with_pool_loop_product
Note that we accumulate the HTML code returned from the
compute function `compute_motion_and_forces` that runs the simulation
and returns the results as HTML code. Figure ref{pp:flask_pool3:fig1}
features a mathematical description of the application, LaTeX symbols as parameter names, and two input values for two parameters, leading to $2\times 2=4$ runs,
and hence four lines of plots. The example demonstrates how easy it is to quickly
perform parameter studies by simply 1) writing the compute function with
loops and `pool.get_values`, 2) separating input values by `&` in the GUI.

FIGURE: [fig-pp/flask_pool3_results.png, width=800] Web interface with documentation, LaTeX symbols, and multiple input values. label{pp:flask_pool3:fig1}

However, writing nested loops for a lot of parameters is unnecessary tedious.
We can use the `itertools.product` function to compute all possible
combinations and simplify the loop. This function takes a set of
lists or tuples and returns an iterator over all combinations of all
the elements in the lists/tuples. As an example,

!bc pyshell
>>> import itertools
>>> values1 = [1, -1]
>>> values2 = [2, 4, 6]
>>> combinations = itertools.product(values1, values2)
>>> for combination in combinations:
...     print combination
(1, 2)
(1, 4)
(1, 6)
(-1, 2)
(-1, 4)
(-1, 6)
!ec
The single loop is equivalent to

!bc pycod
for value1 in values1:
    for value2 in values2:
        combination = (value1, value2)
	print combination
!ec
With an unknown number of lists as arguments to `itertools.prodct` one
can use the construction

!bc pycod
values = [values1, values2]
combinations = itertools.product(*values)
!ec

With these ideas we can generalize our implementation of nested loops
over multiple values of the parameters:

@@@CODE src-pp/compute.py fromto: def compute_motion_and_forces_with_pool_loop_product@def compute_average
This is the type of implementation recommended in applications.


!split
===== Login and archival of results =====

Parampool has a feature that allows a user to create an account, log in,
and save the results from simulations.
The results of a run consists of the
HTML code and plots, which are stored in a database.
Later, old results can be retrieved in the GUI. Enabling login
is just a matter of writing `enable_login=True` in the call
to the "`generate`": "https://github.com/hplgit/parampool/tree/master/doc/src/pp/src-pp/flask6" function:

@@@CODE src-pp/flask6/generate.py

The generated `controller.py` file is now much more complicated in the
Flask case, but the details are not important for the plain user of
Parampool. The usage should be explanatory: first click on `Register` to
register a new user, later one can just click on `Login`.
After having run a simlation, a *Comments* field arises where one can
add comments about this run, and then click on *Add* if the results
are sufficiently interesting to be stored in the database. The upper
right corner has a link *Previous simulations* which gives access to
previous results in the database. At the bottom of the page with
previous runs, there is a *Delete all* button that clears the database.

=== Problems with sending email ===

In case of error messages regarding sending email through Google's
server, it may help to add the following line to `controller.py`, e.g.,
right before the `send_email` function:

!bc pycod
app.config['MAIL_SERVER'] = 'smtp.gmail.com'
!ec

===== Python expressions as input =====

One can use Python expressions like `sin(0.5)*exp(-1)` in the input
fields. Parampool will recognize arithmetic expressions or use of
mathematical functions, and in such cases run `eval` on the input
to interpret it. If special functions are needed, e.g., the input
is like `myfunc(0.1)`, one can supply a namespace to the data
item in question through the `namespace` parameter. Here we create
a custom namespace for a parameter, where the namespace includes
`myfunc` from `mymodule` and all functions (or more precisely, all names)
in `yourmodule` that
do not start with an underscore:

!bc pycod
import mymodule, yourmodule
namespace = {'myfunc': mymodule.myfunc}
namespace.update({key: value for key, value in
                  yourmodule.__dict__.iteritems()
		  if not key.startswith('_')}

======= Exercises =======

===== Exercise: Make a web app for integration =====
label{pp:exer:integrate}
file=integrate

The purpose of this exercise is to use Parampool to generate a
simple web application for integrating functions: $\int_a^bf(x)dx$.
Provide a symbolic expression for $f(x)$ and the limits $a$ and $b$
as input. The application first attempts to
compute the integral $\int f(x)dx$ symbolically using `sympy`,
without limits.
If that does not succeed, it computes $\int_a^b f(x)dx$
numerically by the, e.g., Trapezoidal rule.
The compute function should return nicely typeset formula for
the integrand (use `sympy.latex`) and also the result in case of
symbolic integration.

!bhint
The relevant `sympy` code needs to turn the string expression
for $f(x)$ into a valid Python function. This can be done with
the `sympify` and `lamdify` utilities. Given some string `s`
containing an expression, e.g., s = 'x*sin(x)', the following code
makes a `sympy` expression and a valid Python function `f(x): return x*sin(x)`:

!bc pycod
import sympy as sym
expr = sym.sympify(s)
x = sym.Symbol('x')
f = sym.lambdify([x], expr)
!ec
Using these constructions, the following function
tries to integrate symbolically and then numerically if necessary:

!bc pycod
def integrate(string_expression, a, b):
    assert isinstance(string_expression, str)
    import sympy as sym
    expr = sym.sympify(string_expression)

===== Exercise: Make a web app for studying vibrations =====

Download the "bumpy": "https://github.com/hplgit/bumpy" for
simulating vibrating mechanical systems governed by the
differential equation

!bt
\begin{equation}
mu'' + f(u') + s(u) = F(t).

!bsubex
Make an interface to the bumpy application where the user can set
the following items.

 * Subpool ``Main``:

   * damping type: linear $f(u')=bu'$ or quadratic $f(u')=b|u'|u'$ (option list)
   * damping parameter $b$
   * subpool ``spring''
   * subpool ``excitation''
 * Subpool ``spring'':
   * an option list for selected formulas for the spring $s(u)$:
     * $s(u)= ku$ (linear spring)
     * $s(u)= ku( + \frac{1}{6}x^3)$ (first two Taylor-series terms
       for $k\sin u$)
     * $s(u) = k\sin u$ (pendulum ``spring'' caused by gravity)
   * $k$
 * Subpool ``excitation'':

===== Problem: Make a coin flipper =====
file=coin_flipper

Make a web application where we can set the number of coins, $m$, to
be flipped. Guess the maximum number of heads, $n$. If the number of
heads is less than or equal to $n$, you earn $m-n$ points.  Clicking
on the *Submit* button (whose name should rather be *Flip*) shows
images of coins with heads and tails according to a random flip of
each coin as well as the total number of earned points.  Make a button
to reset the game.

!bhint
See URL: "random.org/coins" for inspiration and images of coins.
Use a global variable in the compute module to hold the number of
earned points.

===== Exercise: Make a web app for the Lorenz system =====
label{pp:exer:lorenz}
file=lorenz

The famous
"Lorez system": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system"
for illustrating chaotic motion is given by

!bt
\begin{align}
x'(t) &= s(y(t) - x(t)),\\
y'(t) &= x(t)(r-z(t)) - y(t),\\
z'(t) &= x(t)y(t) - bz(t),
\end{align}
!et
with initial conditions $x(0)=x_0$, $y(0)=y_0$, and $z(0)=z_0$.
Make a web app that can solve this system and visualize its solution.
The web interface must allow for setting $x_0$, $y_0$, $z_0$, $r$, $s$, $b$,
the number of time steps (or the time step), and the final time $T$ for
the simulation.

===== Exercise: Customize an automatically generated web app =====
label{pp:exer:custom1}
file=on_off_vars

Suppose you want to evaluate the formula,

!bt
\[ f(x) = c_0 + c_1x + x^{p_1} + x^{p_2},\]
!et
but you want to control whether the two last terms are included or not.
A simple compute function is

!bc pycod
def formula(x=1.0, c0=0.0, c1=1.0, p1=0.0, p2=0.0,
            include_p1=True, include_p2=True):
    r = c0 + c1*x
    if include_p1:
        r += x**p1
    if include_p2:
        r += x**p2
    return r
!ec
Running the Parampool web generator on this compute function leads to
the following GUI:

<linebreak>
<linebreak>

FIGURE: [fig-pp/on_off_vars_default_UI, width=500 frac=0.7]

<linebreak>
<linebreak>

However, it would look nicer if the boolean variables were grouped with
their corresponding numbers, as here (also including results from
the computation of the formula):

<linebreak>
<linebreak>

FIGURE: [fig-pp/on_off_vars_desired_UI, width=500 frac=0.7]

<linebreak>
<linebreak>

Edit the generated web application so that the user interface becomes
as desired.

!bhint
Split the `form` data structure
into two lists: one with pure numbers as fields and one with
a list of tuples of a boolean and its corresponding number. Send both
form lists to `render_template`. Edit `view.html` such that you first
process all fields in the form with pure numbers and then you
process all fields in the form with both a boolean and a number.
In the latter case, use two columns per row in the table that formats
the input fields.
!ehint

!bsol
An appropriate `compute.py` file is

@@@CODE exer-pp/on_off_vars/compute.py

First we need to generate the web app via a `generator.py` file:

@@@CODE exer-pp/on_off_vars/_generate.py

Finally, we must edit `view.html` file so it looks as follows:

@@@CODE exer-pp/on_off_vars/templates/view.html
!esol


======= Deployment =======

The most obvious servers to deploy web applications on, like Google App Engine,
only support very light weight Python. For heavier scientific applications
we may need more tools; SSH access, a Fortran compiler, etc. Therefore we
introduce two servers we recommend for the scientific computing usage.

===== Wakari =====

"Wakari":"https://www.wakari.io" is originally meant to be a Python
data analysis environment for internet-accessible services and sharing
of computing environments.  It does not allow users to deploy
webservers that can be accessed by others. However, accessing a Flask
server process running in Wakari is possible using SSH tunneling:

!bc sys
wakari-terminal> python controller.py
laptop-terminal> ssh -p [port] -f -N -L 5000:localhost:5000 \
                 [username]@[wakari-hostname].wakari.io
!ec

!bnotice Port - username - hostname

Information about which port to forward, as well as username and
wakari-hostname, is available under `SSH Access` at the user submeu in
Wakari.

FIGURE: [fig-pp/wakari1.png, width=350 frac=0.6]

It is also necessary to add your
public SSH key to Wakari
"Settings":"https://www.wakari.io/settings/sshkeys".

!enotice

Now the application is available as usual at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
on your laptop.

Even though only Flask and not Django is pre-installed in Wakari, it
is relatively straight-forward to download the Django
"source":"https://www.djangoproject.com/download/" and install it
locally on your user. (Also, if Gnuplot is to be installed and
compiled with PNG support, the library `pnglib` needs to be installed
before Gnuplot is compiled. The Parampool repo features a "script":
"https://github.com/hplgit/parampool/tree/master/doc/src/pp/src-pp/misc/install_on_wakari.sh"
that demonstrates how to install various scientific computing packages
on Wakari.)

#The script `install_on_wakari.sh` in the top
#directory of cbc-websolver accomplishes this.

===== Local server =====

If only little traffic is expected for a web application,
it is possible to run Flask
and Django through a CGI script. The script imports and starts the
application's wsgi handler and works as a gateway between the Internet
and the Flask or Django server.

The simplest example of a Python CGI script running Flask goes like

!bc pycod
#!/usr/bin/python
from wsgiref.handlers import CGIHandler
from controller import app

CGIHandler().run(app)
!ec

This code assumes that the Python executable is located
in `/usr/bin/` and
up-to-date version wise, and that all required Python modules are in
directories listed in the
`PYTHONPATH` environment variable. These modules must be accessible
for any user. Sometimes `/usr/bin/python` is too old so you need to
compiler a newer version and use its path in the
header of the CGI script. In case you run such a ``private'' Python
installation, all necessary modules must also be installed.
Also make sure that `controller.py` is in a directory listed in
`PYTHONPATH`, or add the directory to `sys.path`:

!bc pycod
import sys
# controller.py is in /usr/local/my/software
sys.path.insert(0, '/usr/local/my/software')
from controller import app
!ec

The only difference between the CGI script for Flask and Django is that for
Django one needs to add the directory containing the `settings.py` file to
`sys.path` and set `os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE']`. Also,
the import of the app is a bit different than before:

!bc pycod
sys.path += ['path/to/myproject'] # The folder containing settings.py
os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'myproject.settings'

app = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler()
CGIHandler().run(app)
!ec

Remember that all scripts and modules to be accessed from the web need to
have permissions for everyone to read and execute. This can be done by, e.g.,
`chmod 755 filename`.
